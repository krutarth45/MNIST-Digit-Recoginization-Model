# MNIST-Digit-Recoginization-Model
I have built 2D CNN for the keras MNIST Digit Recognition dataset.
Each image is 28X28 pixels in size thus in total each image is of 784 pixels.
There are 60000 images in Training dataset and 10000 images are used for testing.
In this project Conv2d, Maxpooling, dropout, flatten and dense layers are used in the model.
Model has achieved 99.2% accuracy.
